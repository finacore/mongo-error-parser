# MongoDB error Parser (MEPARSER)
[![Go Reference](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/github.com/gsdenys/meparser.svg)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/gsdenys/meparser)

This module is a free software and their objective is to facilitate the MongoDB error compression, transforming it in a JSON convertibles object readable by humans.

This package has a strong code documentations that generates the fullfil tutorial disponible at [go.dev](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/gsdenys/meparser) reference page, that is enough for their usage.

This lib use [Sonarcloud](https://sonarcloud.io/) combined with [Horusec](https://horusec.io/) to understand the code quality and security, blocking the pull request in any vulnerability incidence.

As well as security, performance is a fundamental factor of all software, package or modules. This way, this package use the __benchmark regression__ to ensure that no performance gaps ocours.
